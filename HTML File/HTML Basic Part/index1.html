      Russia on Tuesday ordered a six-month ban on gasoline exports from March 1
      to keep prices stable amid rising demand from consumers and farmers and to
      allow for maintenance of refineries in the world's second-largest oil
      exporter.

      RBC, citing an unidentified source, said Prime Minister Mikhail
      Mishustin had approved the ban after Novak proposed it in a letter dated
      February 21. A second source told Reuters that the decision had been made
      but the decree had not yet been issued.
